Dear [Jothish21] -- Below is the feedback for your assignment. Please review carefully, and stop by office hours if you have any questions about the feedback.

Overall good job. You just need to take a second look at your plots and how someone might view them if they weren't in the class. Also, if it helps, markdown allows you to include text outside of the code chunks. This could be used for your discussoin/narrative questions.

## Feedback

### Exercise 1: `[10 / 10 points]`

- Plot: `[6 / 6 points]`
- Narrative: `[4 / 4 points]`
- Feedback: [Good Job]

### Exercise 2: `[18/ 20 points]`

a. `[8 / 8 points]`

  - Histogram: `[3 / 3]`
  - Boxplot: `[3 / 3]`
  - Narrative: `[2 / 2]`
  - Feedback: [It might be a good idea to label you x axis so that viewsers (unfamiliar with the topic) can understand it at first glance.]

b. `[5 / 5 points]`

  - Boxplot: `[3 / 3]`
  - Narrative: `[2 / 2]`
  - Feedback: [Insert feedback here.]

c. `[0 / 2 points]`

  - Feedback: [You removed the actual years and not the x-axis title. Just having "year" there tells the viewer nothing. The graph also added redundancy with the men and women labels AND the legend.]

d. `[5 / 5 points]`

  - Time series plot: `[3 / 3]`
  - Narrative: `[2 / 2]`
  - Feedback: [Confidence intervals might have been a better choice here than a regresison line.]

### Exercise 3: `[19 / 20 points]`

a. `[2 / 2]`
  - Feedback: [Insert feedback here.]

b. `[2 / 2]`
  - Feedback: [Insert feedback here.]

c. `[15 / 16]` (2 points each)
  - Feedback: [Here you might want to use the grid.arrange(), to align the graphs. Some info: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/vignettes/arrangeGrob.html]
  
### Exercise 4: `[5 / 10 points]`

- Plot: `[1 / 6 points]`
- Narrative: `[4 / 4 points]`
- Feedback: [The x-axis doesn't make sense as it doesn't show each neighborhood pricing over time, but instead shows pricing for a random year.]

### Exercise 5: `[15 / 20 points]`

Feedback: [Not all code chunks were commented. Please do this so we know you're not just copying and pasting without going over what the code does.]

### Overall: `[20 / 20 points]`

- `[5 / 5]` - Doesn't require reproduction: .md file is in repo, figures show up in the .md file on GitHub, no egregious errors requiring reproducing the entire analysis to be able to follow it.
- `[3 / 3]` - Code style: Line breaks after `|>` and `+`, spaces around operators, spaces after commas, lines not too long, etc.
- `[3 / 3]` - Code smell: Messy / unnecessarily complex code, difficult to follow, unaddressed warnings, etc.
- `[3 / 3]` - Quality and quantity of commits: No uninformative/nonsense text in commit messages, entire assignment not committed in a single commit.
- `[3 / 3]` - Reasonably sized figures.
- `[3 / 3]` - Font size, organization: No crazy large text for narrative, questions answered in order and identified, easy to follow.

## Late penalty

- [ ] On time: No penalty
- [ ] Late, but same day (before midnight): -10 points
- [ ] Late, but next day: -20 points
